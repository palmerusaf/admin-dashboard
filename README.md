## Purpose
The Purpose of this project was to practice a become somewhat proficient using css grid.
## Lessons learned
* when you use flexbox/grid
* that flexbox doesn't have justify-self but you can use margin [instead](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment/Box_Alignment_in_Flexbox)
* how to use an overlay to help in design build
* how to add a circle background using position relative hacks
## Room for improvement
* In the future I need to work on using minmax to greater effect to make pages more responsive.
